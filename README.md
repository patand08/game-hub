Decided to take the React course by Code With Mosh to review and update my knowledge on React.js. This is a project from the training part 1 (finished) and 2 (finished). I took the liberty to do some small changes, but overall it's the same project as the one presented on the course.

Stack: React.js, Chakra UI, React-Query, React Router and zustand

My Changes:

- used react spinnner
- added buttons for clearing the queries
- removed the emojis (so ugly, sorry)
- adding a drawer for selecting genres on small devices
- changed some icons and placements
- added ability to zoom in game images
- better clicking areas and navigation of many props (cards, genres, images, etc...)
- added return button from detail page
- added github button

Vercel deploy: https://game-hub-henna-delta.vercel.app/

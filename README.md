This is a project from Code With Mosh's React training part 1 (finished) and part 2 (on going). I took the liberty to do some fast changes, such as adding buttons for clearing the queries + changing some icons and placements, but overall it's the same project as the one presented on the course.

Stack: React.js, Chakra UI, React-Query, zustand

Vercel deploy: https://game-hub-henna-delta.vercel.app/

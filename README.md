This is a project from Code With Mosh's React training part 1 (finished) and part 2 (finished). I took the liberty to do some small changes, but overall it's the same project as the one presented on the course.

Stack: React.js, Chakra UI, React-Query, React Router and zustand

My Changes:

- React spinnner
- buttons for clearing the queries
- removing the emojis (so ugly, sorry)
- adding a drawer for selecting genres on small devices
- changing some icons and placements
- ability to zoom in game images
- better clicking area of many props (cards, genres, images, etc...)

Vercel deploy: https://game-hub-henna-delta.vercel.app/
